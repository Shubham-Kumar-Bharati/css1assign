                <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elements</li>
                <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
                <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file .</li>
                <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <font size="4"><b class="yellow">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b></font> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>

      <p class="brown">when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.</p> 
      <p class="brown">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p> 
      <p class="brown">There is a wide range of selector available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
